# Ashwani Kumar | Computational Engineering Researcher

This is the personal portfolio website of **Ashwani Kumar**, a researcher at ETH Zürich specializing in Multiphysics simulations, Machine Learning, and Material Modeling.

## 🚀 Key Features

This portfolio has been enhanced with several custom features:

-   **Interactive Background**: A custom particle network animation inspired by neural networks and molecular structures.
-   **Glassmorphism UI**: Modern, semi-transparent design elements for a premium feel.
-   **Deep Linking Loop**: Improved navigation logic (History API) to support direct linking to sections (e.g., `#portfolio`, `#about`).
-   **Performance Optimized**: Mobile-responsive animation that reduces battery usage on non-desktop devices.
-   **SEO Ready**: Full Open Graph and Twitter card meta tag support.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **HTML5 & CSS3**: Semantic markup and custom variables/animations.
-   **Vanilla JavaScript**: No heavy frameworks, just clean, fast code.
-   **HTML5 Canvas**: For the background particle simulation.
-   **IonIcons**: For vector iconography.
